	<h1>The Revelation Project</h1>
	<h2>By Biblical Blueprints</h2>

	<p>
		The book of Revelation was written to be read by God's slaves.  It is full of symbols that they would have understood, warning them about the imminent tribulation against Christians, and the wrath against the Jews.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pastor Phil Kayser has been studying the book of Revelation for over 30 years.  Starting in May 2015, he began teaching a sermon series studying it verse by verse.  As of late 2017, he is up to chapter 12, with about half the book left to go.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides the sermons, Biblical Blueprints will be publishing other study guides, explanations, and visualizations to make the book clearer to modern readers, as well as give historical context for the events described in the book.
	</p>
	<h3>Historical timeline</h3>
	<p>
		Pastor Kayser is compiling a historical timeline of the events described in Revelation, and they are available in a visual <a href="/timeline/">timeline</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The timeline is still in a very early state, in terms of both data and usability.  We will be updating it over time to make it easier to navigate, tweak dates and add more events as research continues, add more detailed descriptions of the events with links to the verses describing them.
	</p>
	<h3>
		The majority text, in its chiastic structure
	</h3>
	<p>
		The book of Revelation is one of the most poorly-translated books in the Bible.  <a href="/structure/">This translation of the majority text</a> by Wilbur Pickering is displayed in the chiastic structur identified by Pastor Kayser.
	</p>
	<p>
		The text is laid out in its <a href="/structure/explanation.html#the-pattern">chiastic structure</a> instead of by chapter number, making it easier to read.  Click on the colored bars to view the patterns inside each paired section.
	</p>
	<p>
		The text and audio recordings of the sermons are aligned next to the relevant verses.
	</p>
	<h3>
		More to come
	</h3>
	<p>
		With adequate funding and time, there are many resources we plan on making available, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Relevant passages from secular historians such as Josephus linked alongside verse text and timeline events
		</li>
		<li>
			Symbology cheatsheets (e.g. "white horse = Emperor Tiberius")
		</li>
		<li>
			Symbology references (e.g., all other places in the Bible referencing "Babylon")
		</li>
		<li>
			Detailed technical notes on individual verses
		</li>
	</ul>
