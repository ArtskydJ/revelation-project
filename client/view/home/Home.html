		<h1>The Revelation Project</h1>

	</div>

	<p>
		Revelation was a letter written to be read by Christians at the time when it was written.  It is full of symbols that they would have understood, warning them about the imminent tribulation of Christians, and the wrath against the Jews.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is rich with instruction we can apply now to spiritual warfare, civil government, physical danger, and plans for our future.
	</p>
	<h3>The project</h3>
	<p>
		Pastor Phil Kayser has been studying Revelation for over 30 years.  Starting in May 2015, he began a sermon series studying it verse by verse.  The sermon series was concluded in December 2018.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides sermons, Biblical Blueprints is also publishing study guides, explanations, and visualizations to make the book clearer to modern readers, and give historical context for the events described in the book.
	</p>
	<h3>Sermons</h3>
	<p>
		<StateLink state="main.sermons">The full text and audio of every sermon</StateLink> is available within a week of being preached.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also have a podcast feed - find it in your podcast app by searching for "Revelation Project: Sermons".
	</p>
	<h3>Historical timeline</h3>
	<p>
		Pastor Kayser is compiling a historical timeline of the events described in Revelation, and they are available in a visual <StateLink state="main.timeline">timeline</StateLink>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The timeline is still in a very early stage in terms of data and usability.  We will update it over time to make it easier to navigate, tweak dates and add more events as research continues, and add more detailed descriptions of the events with links to the verses describing them.
	</p>
	<h3>
		The majority text, in its chiastic structure
	</h3>
	<p>
		Revelation has more textual critical issues (and thus translational differences) than any other book of the Bible. Rather than constantly discussing the technical issues of textual criticism and reasons why we differ from various translations, we chose to use Wilbur Pickeringâ€™s translation of Revelation. It is based on family 35 of the Byzantine tradition, which Pastor Kayser considers the best representative of the Ecclesiastical Text.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is this translation that is <StateLink state="main.structure.text">displayed here</StateLink>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The text is laid out in the <StateLink state="main.structure.explanation" anchor="the-pattern">chiastic structure</StateLink> identified by Pastor Kayser instead of by chapter number, making it easier to read.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sermon text and audio recordings are aligned next to the relevant verses.
	</p>
	<h3>
		More to come
	</h3>
	<p>
		With adequate funding and time, there are many resources we plan to make available, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Relevant passages from secular historians such as Josephus linked alongside verse text and timeline events
		</li>
		<li>
			Symbology cheatsheets (e.g. "white horse = Emperor Tiberius")
		</li>
		<li>
			Symbology references (e.g., all other places in the Bible referencing "Babylon")
		</li>
		<li>
			Detailed technical notes on individual verses
		</li>
	</ul>
